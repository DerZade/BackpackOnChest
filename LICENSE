================================================================================
                Gruppe Adler Arma Public License (GRAD APL) v1.1
================================================================================

Disclaimer

  Some bits of this license may make the entire license seem like a joke. But
  it’s not. We just hate reading boring EULAs. So do not take it lightly. We
  have a lawyer. And he bites, too!
________________________________________________________________________________

Intro

  - This license handles rights and permissions of an open source project.
  - This is meant to foster creative collaboration, not ripping mods and
    getting credit for it.
  - The creator can waive/modify parts of this license in his creator’s notes.
    Both this GRAD APL and the creator’s notes are complementary. When 
    conflicting, creator’s notes take precedence. He did the work, he calls the
    shots.
  - Written consent is necessary to waive parts of this license or the entire
    license.
  - When terminology or conditions are open to interpretation, it is assumed
    that the creator’s interpretation is the only one that matters. 
    Deal with it. B)
  - If certain aspects of this license become invalid, copyright law takes over
    in the areas the license becomes invalid. The other parts of this license
    shall remain legally binding.
________________________________________________________________________________

Obligations

  - You must not reupload to a public source (1), ever, at any time under any
    circumstances other than the ones described in this license. If your granny
    is about to die because you can’t reupload, you better start measuring the
    coffin.
  - Commercial use/exploitation of this modification is not permitted. This
    overrides the general license change made by Bohemia to grant commercial
    exploitation of modifications.
  - When publishing a derivative of this product you may not use a name that
    might create the impression that your version is an official release.
________________________________________________________________________________

Rights

  - If you add code to the modification that adds/modifies ingame functionality
    in a meaningful manner (2), you are free to distribute the new modification
    as your own.
  - You are allowed to copy an unmodified version (3) of this modification for
    personal or clan use if copyright/credit is maintained. 
  - You can take small parts (2) (functions /scripts) and use them modified or
    unmodified in your own work. Give credit where credit is due!
________________________________________________________________________________

Consequences

  If you ignore this license, you are faced with certain doom and everyone will
  hate you...
  
  ...Oh, and perhaps sue you.

Footnotes

  (1) Specifically Steam Workshop, Armaholic, PlayWith6 or any other public mod
      hosters. If you host the mods on your private/clan server and use programs
      like Arma3Sync to make them available to a limited user base, this does
      not apply to you.
  (2) The creator’s definition is meant. Use your common sense!
      If you are not sure, ask!
  (3) You must not just copy the pbos into your own mod. Include the whole mod!
